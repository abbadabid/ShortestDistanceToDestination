Shortest Path Finder (Dijkstra's Algorithm)

Overview
This project implements **Dijkstra's Algorithm to find the shortest path between nodes in a weighted graph. The implementation uses **Priority Queue (Min-Heap) for efficiency.

Features
- Graph representation using **adjacency list**
- **Dijkstra's Algorithm** for shortest path calculation
- Tracking multiple shortest paths**
- Efficient Priority Queue (Min-Heap) using `heapq`
- Functionality to find all paths leading to the shortest distance
